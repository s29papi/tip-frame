## What does this Frame do? 
This Frame facilitates domain name queries across a diverse character set by interfacing with 3dns's API. Utilizing this interface, it generates an image presenting key domain information, including its tokenization availability, associated tokenization costs, and recurring renewal fees. Distinguished by its robust architecture and bolstered by 3dns, it extends its functionality by seamlessly integrating with a direct 3dns checkout process.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser in any local frame debugger to see the result.

You can start editing the frame by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deployment
You need to provide the required environment variables to generate this frame. See .env.example.
